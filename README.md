Project title: “Are the Browns Losing Seasons Cleveland Weathers Fault?”https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services#/viewData
Teams members:  Julie Kitzler, Michelle Fegatelli, Luke Fedeli, Mel Sabo, Jah	 
Project Description:  To correlate the Cleveland Browns performance against the weather forecast 
Research Questions to be Answered:
1.	Is there a correlation between Browns wins or losses in wet weather in Cleveland, Ohio?
2.	Is there a correlation between Browns wins or losses in dry weather in Cleveland, Ohio?
3.	 Is there a correlation between total rainfall versus Browns total game points?
4.	Is there a correlation between temperature versus Browns total game points?
Datasets to be used: Data from the Cleveland Browns seasons 1985 to 1994
•	Historical Weather CSV files- https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services#/editDataDefinition
•	NFL Statistics- https://www.kaggle.com/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data?select=spreadspoke_scores.csv.

# Project 1 Plan 
1.	Clean Browns Data(12/16)
    i.	What we need:
        1. W/L. (adding) 
    ii.	Game Dates & Times (1985-1994).
        1. Schedule_dates.
        2. Schedule_season.	
    iii. Team column.
    iv.	Total home points.
        1. Score_home.
        2. Score_away.
        
2.	Create Weather Scraping API and write to new CSV (Wednesday 12/16)

3.	Merge Data (12/16 - 12/18)

4.	Analyze Data (12/18)
    a.	Calculations. 
    b.	Correlation & regression.
    
5.	Visualize Data (Matplotlibs)
    a.	Is there a correlation between Browns wins or losses in wet weather in Cleveland, Ohio?
    b.	Is there a correlation between Browns wins or losses in dry weather in Cleveland, Ohio?
    c.	Is there a correlation between total rainfall versus Browns total game points?
    d.	Is there a correlation between temperature versus Browns total game points?
    
6.	Present Data (Due: 12/23, Should be complete 12/21 )
    a.	May need to add assumption footnote about weather and times of games if we do not gather specific game times.
